Hafa Afai!

My name is Kamille Morrison, an island girl navigating through life and the tech world. I'm open to learning more about Computer Science and Game Development. You can find me tinkering with FL studio as I also enjoy making music and singing. I hope to one day create something meaningful that I can give back to the world whether that be in the tech industry or through music.
